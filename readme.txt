Our interactive visualization presents COVID-19 statistics, encompassing total cases and deaths, for each state in the United States. Initially, users encounter a zoomable and draggable map of the US, delineated by state outlines. Upon clicking on a state, the map zooms in, background blurs, revealing a bar chart displaying either the total confirmed cases or total deaths (switchable via buttons) for that specific state across time. We deliberated using line charts but opted for bar charts since we're showcasing accumulated counts rather than monthly changes. The decision to keep the plots separate was made due to substantial differences in y-axis scales (confirmed cases greatly outnumber deaths). Each bar chart includes a temporal x-axis spanning from December 2019 to July 2023, with the y-axis representing the affected population count. Ensuring clarity, each bar chart's title accurately reflects the displayed data, including the selected state's name. Additionally, a reset button is incorporated to "close" the graph and restore the map to its original state, facilitating the selection of another state.

Once we settled on COVID statistics as our project focus, our team divided tasks: two members researched interactive map creation, while another cleaned raw datasets (pandas). We faced initial challenges in getting the map to function smoothly, experimenting with two methods: topojson and geojson. Topojson, utilizing d3, offered smoother zoom and transitions between states compared to the choppy animation of geojson. With the interactive map established and datasets cleaned, we shifted focus to creating static graphs from the data. This process was time-intensive as we developed multiple functions to extract state-specific data from our CSV files and generated visualizations. Finally, we enhanced the aesthetics of our interactive visualization through styling choices, including color schemes and the positioning of graphs and buttons. To allow the audience to more effectively differentiate between the two different graphs (cases/deaths), we made the line on each graph a different color, blue for confirmed cases and orange for deaths. We ran into a lot of trouble formatting our website as none of us are familiar with front-end coding. Over the course of the project, we met in person four times, investing a total of around 30 hours to bring it to completion.
